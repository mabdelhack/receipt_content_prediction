# Receipt Content Prediction

This is a repository that contains code for a machine learning model to predict
receipt content from images of receipts.
It was a solution to the Zindi and AI Hack [Bill Classification in Tunisia Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai-hack-tunisia-1-computer-vision-challenge-1) and it received fourth place at the time.

The model is available both in Python and jupyter-notebook format. The notebook version was tested using Google Colab framework.

The model is a convolutional neural network that is trained from scratch on the dataset and built using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
